#QUESTION 1: : By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? 
#              Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. 
#              The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
#==>By default,Django signals are executed synchronously, meaning they run in the same thread as the request or the operation that triggers them. 
#              This can impact performance because the signal handler is executed immediately after the signal is sent, 
#              and the request will not complete until the signal handler finishes

#Question 2: Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller? 
#            Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. 
#            The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
#==>	Yes, by default, Django signals run in the same thread as the caller. 
#            This means that the signal handler will block the callerâ€™s execution until it finishes running

#Question 3: By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? 
#            Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. 
#            The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.

#==> Yes,by default Django signals such as post_save run within the same database transaction as the caller. 
#           If the caller rolls back the transaction,the signal handler's operations are also rolled back.
